How to Run the Most Active Cookie Finder Script
===============================================

Prerequisites:
---------------
- Python 3 installed on your system.

Instructions:
-------------
1. Place the ‘most_active.py’ script in a folder on your system.

2. Open a command line interface (CLI) like Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows).

3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located. For example, if the script is on your desktop, you would use:
   - Windows: ‘cd Desktop’ 
   - macOS/Linux: ‘cd ~/Desktop’

4. To run the script, use the following command format:
python most_active.py -f path_to_log_file -d YYYY-MM-DD
- Replace `path_to_log_file` with the path to your log file.
- Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with the date you want to query in the format Year-Month-Day.

5. Press Enter to run the script. If there are any most active cookies for the given date, they will be displayed on the screen.
